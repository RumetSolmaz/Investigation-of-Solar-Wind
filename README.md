Investigation of Solar Wind Variations in the Solar System:
Developed a Python-based analysis to investigate solar wind parameters, including magnetic field intensity (IMF Btot, IMF Bz), density, speed, temperature, and pressure, at varying distances from the Sun (Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter). Utilized NASAâ€™s OMNI data from the WIND spacecraft, calculated temperature and pressures using physical formulas, and created comparative visualizations for solar wind properties across the planets. Analyzed trends and variations in solar wind dynamics to understand its behavior throughout the solar system.
